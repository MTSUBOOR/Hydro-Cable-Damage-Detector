# Hydro-Cable-Damage-Detector

Unfortunately, I don't have the code for this project. All the code is on an old PC that is no longer functional. On top of that the physical apparatus is likely still at the University of Manitoba, where I worked on it.

This was something I made, with guidance from my mentor at the University of Manitoba, as a tool to be used in my research on finding water damage in hydro cables. This reseach was for my science fair project. At the time I wasn't focused on the computer science aspect (it was more of a means to an end), but I ended up enjoying the development of the program more than the research aspect. 

HOWEVER, I did find a pdf of my poster for the science fair for which I did this project, that has some images and an explanation of my science fair project. Note: there isn't much(if any) mention of the development done to make the research I did possible, since at the time my focus was to use this as a project in a science fair. But it's still some good context.

Sorry I can't provide more.
